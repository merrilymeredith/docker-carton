=============

Docker build: Carton on perl:latest on Debian testing

* * *

https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/merrilymeredith/carton/

Simply adds the latest Carton onto library/perl:latest, which is built on
Debian (jessie/sid).

I didn't want to mess with Ubuntu or CentOS builds or unnecessary use of
perlbrew/plenv.

A cleaner kit, I think.  Be aware this isn't version-stable though.
